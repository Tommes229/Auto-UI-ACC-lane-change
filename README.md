A Unity-based car simulation project for university research, designed to evaluate the advantages of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) in two driving scenarios. The simulation collects data and user experiences from a small group of participants.

---

## Overview

This project provided an interactive car driving experience where users drove in two modes:

1. **Without ACC:** Manual control of the car's speed and distance.
2. **With ACC:** ACC system assists the driver by automatically maintaining speed and safe distance from vehicles ahead.

The aim is to assess the potential benefits and usability of ACC for drivers.
